   Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page

    Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL.
    Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
    You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered 
    so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS.
    
    ***User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
    ***User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
    ***User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
    ***User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. 
        Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header 
        "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").

    ***User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
    ***User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
    User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

    ***User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
    ***User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
    ***User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. 
        There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
    ***User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
    ***User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section 
        (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
    ***User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element
        (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has 
        that id and contains the corresponding header.
    User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of 
    the screen and should always be visible to the user.
    User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
    You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like:

            <p>In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient
                packages, and act as handy data containers. The object-based nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach
                object theory and syntax in detail, then look at how to create your own objects.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Object_basics">
            <header>Object basics</header>
            <p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.). An object like this is referred to as an <strong>object literal</strong>                — we've literally written out the object contents as we've come to create it.</p>
            <code>var person = {
                name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
                age: 32,
                gender: 'male',
                interests: ['music', 'skiing'],
                bio: function() {
                  alert(this.name[0] + ' ' + this.name[1] + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old. He likes ' + this.interests[0] + ' and ' + this.interests[1] + '.');
                },
                greeting: function() {
                  alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');
                }
              };</code>
            <p>The value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our person object we've got a string, a number, two arrays, and two functions. The first four items are data items, and are referred to as the object's <strong>properties.</strong>                The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and are referred to as the object's <strong>methods.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Dot_notation">
            <header>Dot notation</header>
            <p>The object name (person) acts as the <strong>namespace</strong> — it must be entered first to access anything <strong>encapsulated</strong> inside the object. Next you write a dot, then the item you want to access — this can be the name of
                a simple property, an item of an array property, or a call to one of the object's methods, for example:</p>
            <code>person.age
                        person.interests[1]
                        person.bio()</code>
            <p>It is even possible to make the value of an object member another object thus creating a <strong>sub-namespace.</strong></p>
            <code>var person = {
                    name : {
                        first: 'Bob',
                        last: 'Smith'
                      },
                }
                console.log(person.name.first);
                console.log(person.name.last);
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Bracket_notation">
            <header>Bracket notation</header>
            <p>There is another way to access object properties — using bracket notation. Instead of using these:</p>
            <code>person.age
                    person.name.first</code>
            <p>You can use</p>
            <code>person['age']
                    person['name']['first']</code>
            <p>This looks very similar to how you access the items in an array, and it is basically the same thing — instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's value. It is no wonder that objects
                are sometimes called associative arrays — they map strings to values in the same way that arrays map numbers to values.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Setting_object_members">
            <header>Setting object members</header>
            <p>So far we've only looked at retrieving (or <strong>getting</strong>) object members — you can also <strong>set</strong> (update) the value of object members by simply declaring the member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation), like
                this:
            </p>
            <code>person.age = 45;
                        person['name']['last'] = 'Cratchit';</code>
            <p>Setting members doesn't just stop at updating the values of existing properties and methods; you can also create completely new members.</p>
            <code>person['eyes'] = 'hazel';
                    person.farewell = function() { alert("Bye everybody!"); }</code>
            <p>One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set not only member values dynamically, but member names too. Let's say we wanted users to be able to store custom value types in their people data, by typing the member name
                and value into two text inputs? We could get those values like this:</p>
            <code>var myDataName = nameInput.value;
        var myDataValue = nameValue.value;
        person[myDataName] = myDataValue;</code>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_this">
            <header>What is this</header>
            <p>The <code>this</code> keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside — so in this case this is equivalent to person. So why not just write person instead? When we start creating constructors, etc., this is very useful
                — it will always ensure that the correct values are used when a member's context changes (e.g. two different person object instances may have different names, but will want to use their own name when saying their greeting).</p>
            <code>var person1 = {
        name: 'Chris',
        greeting: function() {
          alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name + '.');
        }
      }
      
      var person2 = {
        name: 'Brian',
        greeting: function() {
          alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name + '.');
        }
      }</code>
            <p>In this case, person1.greeting() will output "Hi! I'm Chris."; person2.greeting() on the other hand will output "Hi! I'm Brian.", even though the method's code is exactly the same in each case. As we said earlier, this is equal to the object
                the code is inside — this isn't hugely useful when you are writing out object literals by hand, but it really comes into its own when you are dynamically generating objects (for example using constructors). It will all become clearer later
                on.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="You_ve_been_using_objects_all_along">
            <header>You ve been using objects all along</header>
            <p>Every time you are using a built-in browser API or JavaScript object, you are using objects, because such features are built using exactly the same kind of object structures that we've been looking at here, albeit more complex ones than our
                own basic custom examples. So when you use string methods like:</p>
            <code>myString.split(',');</code>
            <p>You are using a method available on an instance of the String class. Every time you create a string in your code, that string is automatically created as an instance of String, and therefore has several common methods/properties available
                on it.</p>
